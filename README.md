### Important Notes:
- **Data Transformation**: The dataset included in this repository has undergone a deterministic rescaling transformation for confidentiality reasons. This transformation preserves the statistical structure, relationships, and analytical conclusions, while preventing disclosure of the original raw data.
- **Academic Purpose**: This analysis is intended as a demonstration of MCDM techniques (TOPSIS, PCA, Weighted Sum) rather than nutritional advice.
