# Nutrition-powder
This repository contains the R scripts used for statistical analysis, product development, and process optimization in the project: Optimization of Drying Parameters and Ingredient Ratio for Potatoes Nutrition Powder using Box-Behnken Design (BBD) and Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM)

**This project aims to**
1. Applied Box-Behnken Design (BBD) to model the relationship between drying parameters (Temperature, Slice thickness, and Drying time) and final moisture and identify the optimal drying scheme.
2. Applied Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) to evaluate different recipes and identify the nutritional balance ingredient ratio.
3. Support the valorization of an undervalued agricultural product and

This repository includes R code to:
- Box-Behnken Design and analysis for drying conditions
- Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) for recipe evaluation
- Generate relevant visualizations

### Important Notes:
- **Data Transformation**: The dataset included in this repository has undergone a deterministic rescaling transformation for confidentiality reasons. This transformation preserves the statistical structure, relationships, and analytical conclusions, while preventing disclosure of the original raw data.
- **Academic Purpose**: This analysis is intended as a demonstration of MCDM techniques (TOPSIS, PCA, Weighted Sum) rather than nutritional advice.
